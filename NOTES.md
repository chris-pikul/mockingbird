# Mockingbird Development Notes

I use this file to save ideas and features that I want to implement.

- Pattern Formatting for random generation. Use tokens like date or other printfmt style functions to make whatever wanted.
- Pattern Formatting database of saved entries. A way to save usermade generator format strings.
- Functional json generator that takes a template and produces random json objects using it. Hopefully allow saving of these templates as well.
